# Contribution

First let me say that you are awesome. It is great that you inform you how you can help.

There are many ways in which you can contribute something to this project:

 1. **Reporting bugs:**  If you discover a bug you can report it here.
 2. **Help in development:** There are open tickets? If you know how to resolve them you can do it and open a pull
    request for it.
 3. **Proofreading:** I donâ€™t speak English very well. Maybe you have compassion and want to correct some of my
    mistakes.
